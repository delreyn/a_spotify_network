# A Spotify Analysis

![degree](imgs/degree_centrality.png)

This is a very small project about some playlists from spotify. It was used the [Aircrowd's Million Playlist Dataset](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/spotify-million-playlist-dataset-challenge)

We create and evaluate several metrics such as Betweens Centrality, Closeness etc...

See our [Medium article](https://medium.com/@breno.coelho_70319/network-analysis-in-spotify-playlist-6fa9bcbcb52c).

Check out the [notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/delreyn/a_spotify_network/blob/5d0b3080b92636f76221b6b4ba13b4873eb78cd2/Spotify_million_network_Uni02.ipynb)

We also made an interactive graph view version [here](https://delreyn.github.io/a_spotify_network/network/)
